Encryption and Decryption Algorithms  

This project shows how to use a specially created Java encryption algorithm in addition to the popular encryption technique Blowfish. A variety of file formats, including text files, PowerPoint presentations, zip files, and photos, are encrypted and decrypted by the project.  


**Qualities:**   
**Blowfish Cryptosystem:**  
Designed to offer robust, quick, and adaptable encryption.  
Benefits include speed, flexibility, public domain access, and a high degree of protection.  
Cons: Small block size, symmetric key management difficulties, possible weaknesses, and restricted adoption.  

**Personalized Encryption Method:**  
Developed a decryption and encryption technique for the reverse Caesar cipher.  
Reads a file, uses the Caesar cipher in reverse, writes encrypted data, reads encrypted data, decrypts it, and writes the data that has been decrypted.  
Uses SHA-256 for hashing and verifying passwords in order to guarantee safe access management.  

**Project Elements:**  
**Blowfish Cryptosystem:**  
An explanation of the selection of Blowfish.  
a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks.  
**Personalized Algorithm:**  
An in-depth analysis of the algorithm used in the reverse Caesar cipher.  
Implementation of hashing passwords, writing, decrypting, and reading files encrypted.
